<h1>Let's reflect on some shit.</h1>
<h3><strong><span class= "dating">Dude</span></strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Thoughts on dating:</strong></h4>
<p>Hello! This is some <b>text.</b> Some <em>coded</em> text.</p>
<p>
<h3><strong>Stuff</strong></h3>
<p> Hello again! </p>
<p> Hello <strong>world</strong>... </p>
<p>Remember, there are <b>SIX</b> heading levels!</p>

<h2><span class="element type">Text-Based Elements</span></h2>
<h3>Style v. Semantics</h3>
<p><strong>strong</strong> and <strong>em</strong> are <em>inline-level elements</em> and the more popular choices.</p>
<p> There are <strong>semantic differences</strong> between strong and b and em and i even though they stylistically appear the same on a browser.</p>
<p>Therefore, you have to <strong>gauge the significance of the text</strong> we wish to set as bold or italics and to choose an element accordingly</p>
<h4>Bold:</h4>
<p><strong>strong is bold with a strong importance</strong></p>
<p><b>b is bold with an inline stylistic offset</b></p>
<h4>Italics:</h4>
<p><em>em is italics with a stressed emphasis</em></p>
<p><i>i is italics with an alternative voice or tone (as if placed in quotation marks)</i></p>
<!--Remember, html is a language! It's not just about how the code appears on the browser; it's important to consider how semantic differences in code communicate intentions to others. By the way, this is an html comment; it is NOT visible via the browser-->

<h2>Structural Elements</strong></h2>
<section class="different organizational elements">
<h3><strong>Choosing between div, section, and article:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>div</strong> is for dividers that are purely stylistic. articles and sections are a bit trickier.</p>
<p>If the content adds to the document outline and represents a <em>thematic</em> group of content, use the <strong>section</strong> element.</p>
<p>If the content adds to the document outline and be <em>independently redistributed or syndicated</em>, use the <strong>article</strong> element.</p>
</section>
<section class="other structural elements">
<p><strong>nav</strong> identifies a section of major navigational links on a page</p>
<p><strong>aside</strong>holds content, such as sidebars, inserts, or brief explanations, that is tangentially related to the content surrounding it</p>
<p>When used within an <em>article</em>> element, for example, the <b>aside</b> element may identify content related to the author of the article.</p>
<h4><strong>Remember:</strong> all of the structural elements, including the aside element, are <b>block-level elements</b> and as such <i>will appear on a <b>new line</b></i>, occupying the full available width of the page or of the element they are nested within, also known as their <b>parent element</b>.</h4>
<p>The <strong>footer</strong> element  identifies the <i>closing or end of</i> a page, article, section, or other segment of a page.</p>
<p>Footers are generally found at the <i>bottom</i> of their parent, and the content within it should be relevant to and not diverge from the document or section it is included within.</p>
