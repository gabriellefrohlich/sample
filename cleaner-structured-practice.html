	<h2>Dedicated to the language of html</h2>
	<p>Learning how to code in html is more than creating webpages and displays for browsers; it includes communicating meaning and intention to those viewing your code.</p>

	<h3>Coding Goals</h3>
	<h5>Hope and Vision</h5>
	<p>Html is a pretty straight-forward language; it is in English and explicit in its intention.
	The most confusing elements are the semantic ones; features that visually appear the same on the browser (or are not displayed at all, like structural elements) that have important intention and distinctive purpose.
	My hope is to concretely grasp these topics and be able to code neat, organized, purposeful code.</br>
	<br>Further, as an artist (and kind of aspiring UX designer), aesthetic is important to me.
	I hope to be able to design beautiful interfaces, one's with color, images, shapes, various fonts, columns, and more.
	I especially want to be able to create dynamic pages, or <b>product motion design</b>, as Payton Meyer advised. It not only interests me artistically, but would be of great value when seeking to get hired.</br>
	<br>All in all, I want to create. Art is creation, but above all, <em>communication</em>. Through learning how to communicate via html, I will be able to evolve into a strong, effective creator.</br></p>
